Playwright for E2E testing
Current Status:
Repository is set up on GitHub (Drakeyves/pstarter on dev branch)
Environment variables are configured
Database is connected (Neon PostgreSQL)
Local development server is configured (port 4002)
Vercel deployment is set up
Known Issues:
Build process issues related to SAML Jackson package and jose module
Potential issues with SAML SSO functionality in Vercel deployment
2. Brand-idenity (Brand Identity Repository)
This repository contains the brand identity guidelines and implementation details for the Drake brand. It includes a comprehensive plan for integrating the brand identity into a SaaS application, with a focus on UI/UX elements like colors, typography, and components.
Key Elements:
Dark-themed UI with accent colors (purple, teal, gold, metallic)
Custom components styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
Animations and effects for enhanced user experience
Detailed implementation plan for integrating the brand identity
Implementation Status:
Foundation setup is completed (Tailwind configuration, theme system)
Core components are developed (buttons, cards, form elements, etc.)
Authentication pages are updated with brand styling
Test page is created to showcase all components
UI/UX Implementation Plan
Our plan is to integrate the Drake brand identity from the Brand-idenity repository into the pstarter codebase, focusing on UI/UX improvements while maintaining backend functionality. Here's our streamlined approach:
Phase 1: Foundation Setup
Update Tailwind Configuration
Add custom color palette to Tailwind configuration
Create a custom DaisyUI theme named 'drake'
Set 'drake' as the default dark theme
Set Up Global CSS
Add CSS variables for brand colors
Create component styles using Tailwind's @layer directive
Add custom scrollbar styling and gradient effects
Create Utility Functions
Implement a utility function for conditional class names
Set up theme system functionality
Phase 2: Core Component Development
Create/Update Basic Components
Button component with multiple variants and sizes
Card component with hover effects
Badge component with color variants
Loading spinner component
Develop Form Elements
Input field component with variants
Select dropdown component
Toggle component with animations
Theme toggle component
Create Component Library
Ensure consistent export pattern
Document component usage
Phase 3: Page Transformation
We'll transform pages one by one, starting with authentication pages and moving through the application systematically. For each page:
Replace existing components with our new branded components
Update layout and spacing according to brand guidelines
Add subtle animations for transitions
Test functionality to ensure backend operations remain intact
Document any bugs or issues in the MD folder
Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
Test all components across different screen sizes
Verify accessibility compliance
Fix any bugs or issues
Refine the implementation based on testing results
Bug Tracking Process
For each bug or issue encountered:
Document it in the MD folder with the current date as filename
Include detailed information about the bug
Flag critical issues for professional debugging
Track resolution status
This implementation plan ensures a systematic approach to integrating the brand identity while maintaining the functionality of the existing codebase. The focus is on creating a cohesive, modern UI/UX that enhances the user experience without disrupting backend operations.
