# March 9, 2023 - UI/UX Implementation Log

## Project Status

- Created BRAND_IDENTITY.md in the root directory
- Implemented Phase 1 of UI/UX changes based on the brand identity guidelines
- Set up bug tracking process

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Completed)

1. ✅ Updated Tailwind configuration with brand colors

   - Added custom color palette with accent colors
   - Set up font family configuration
   - Created custom DaisyUI theme named 'propulsion-society'

2. ✅ Set up global CSS variables and utility classes

   - Defined CSS variables for all brand colors
   - Created utility classes for common UI elements
   - Added transition and animation variables

3. ✅ Implemented theme system

   - Updated theme provider to use 'propulsion-society' as default
   - Created ThemeProvider component for consistent application
   - Configured dark mode as the default theme

4. ✅ Created core UI components
   - Custom Button component with gradient backgrounds
   - Card component with subtle gradient and hover effects
   - Badge component with semi-transparent backgrounds
   - Updated toast notifications with brand styling

## Testing Results

- Successfully implemented all Phase 1 components
- Components are properly styled according to brand guidelines
- Dark theme with 'propulsion-society' is applied by default
- Inter font is loaded and applied to all text elements

## Known Issues

- Build error related to SAML Jackson package and jose module (pre-existing issue)
- Linting error in setup-dev-env.js (pre-existing issue)
- These issues are not related to our UI changes and were mentioned in the overview.md as known issues

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Components were initially created in the wrong directory
   **Solution**: Moved all components to the correct pstarter project directory

2. **Challenge**: TypeScript linting errors in \_app.tsx
   **Solution**: Removed unused imports to fix linting errors

3. **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent theme application
   **Solution**: Created a ThemeProvider component that applies the theme on mount

4. **Challenge**: Warning about adding stylesheets in next/head
   **Solution**: Moved the Inter font link from \_app.tsx to \_document.tsx

## Next Steps

- Continue with Phase 2: Core Component Development
- Update remaining auth pages with brand styling
- Implement dashboard and main interfaces
- Test all components across different screen sizes

## Notes for Developers

- All UI components now use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Button, Card, and Badge components follow the brand guidelines
- The dark theme with accent colors is now the default
- Use the custom components from shared directory instead of direct DaisyUI components
- When adding new components, ensure they follow the brand guidelines and use the CSS variables
- Font loading is handled in \_document.tsx to avoid Next.js warnings
