# March 9, 2023 - UI/UX Implementation Log

## Project Status
- Created BRAND_IDENTITY.md in the root directory
- Preparing to implement UI/UX changes based on the brand identity guidelines
- Setting up bug tracking process

## Implementation Plan
1. Begin with foundation setup (Tailwind configuration, theme system)
2. Develop core components following the brand guidelines
3. Transform pages one by one, starting with authentication pages
4. Test and refine the implementation

## Known Issues
None yet - will document issues as they are encountered during implementation.

## Next Steps
- Set up local development environment
- Update Tailwind configuration with brand colors
- Create custom DaisyUI theme
- Implement global CSS variables and utility classes

## Notes for Developers
- All UI/UX changes should follow the guidelines in BRAND_IDENTITY.md

- Document any bugs or issues in this file
- Use minimal, streamlined code while maintaining robust functionality
