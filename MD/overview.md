Overview
We've successfully set up the pstarter project from the GitHub repository Drakeyves/pstarter on the dev branch. This project is a SaaS Starter Kit built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various other technologies for enterprise-ready applications.
What We've Accomplished
Repository Setup
Cloned the repository from GitHub
Checked out the dev branch
Environment Configuration
Set up environment variables using .env.development and .env.local
Connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database (already configured in the environment variables)
Dependencies Installation
Installed all required npm packages
Database Setup
Successfully ran database migrations using Prisma
Synchronized the database schema with the Prisma models
Local Development Server
Configured and started the Next.js development server on port 4002
Verified the server is running correctly
Vercel Deployment
Installed and configured the Vercel CLI
Linked the project to an existing Vercel project (pstarter-dev)
Deployed the application to Vercel
The application is now accessible at: https://pstarter-dev-git-main-drake-s-projects-8196e4d9.vercel.app
Testing Setup
Installed Playwright dependencies for E2E testing
Successfully ran unit tests
Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js structure with additional directories for enterprise features:
components/: React components used throughout the application
pages/: Next.js pages and API routes
prisma/: Database schema and migrations
lib/: Utility functions and shared code
styles/: CSS and Tailwind configuration
public/: Static assets
tests/: E2E and unit tests
hooks/: Custom React hooks
models/: Data models and types
Key Technologies
Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
Prisma: ORM for database access
TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript
NextAuth.js: Authentication solution
SAML Jackson: Enterprise SSO integration
Svix: Webhook orchestration
Retraced: Audit logging
Stripe: Payment processing
Playwright: E2E testing
Common Commands
Start development server: npm run dev
Run unit tests: npm test
Run E2E tests: npm run test:e2e (requires a build first)
Build the application: npm run build
Format code: npm run format
Check types: npm run check-types
Check linting: npm run check-lint
Known Issues
Build Process: There's an issue with the build process related to the SAML Jackson package and the jose module. This prevents running E2E tests that require a production build.
Vercel Deployment: While the deployment to Vercel was successful, there might be issues with the SAML SSO functionality due to the build errors.
Next Steps
Fix Build Issues: Investigate and fix the build issues related to the SAML Jackson package.
Complete E2E Testing: Once the build issues are resolved, run the E2E tests to ensure all functionality is working correctly.
Explore Features: The project includes many enterprise features like SSO, audit logging, and webhook orchestration. Explore these features to understand how they work.
Customize for Your Needs: Modify the application to meet your specific requirements.
