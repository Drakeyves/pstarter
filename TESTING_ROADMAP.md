# SaaS Starter Kit Testing Roadmap

## Current Testing Context (For AI Assistants)

This document is being used as part of an interactive testing process between the user and AI assistant. The current approach is:

1. The AI suggests bite-sized tests for specific features
2. The user executes the tests and reports back results
3. The AI updates this document with findings and suggests the next tests
4. Both parties debug issues as they arise

When responding to the user:
- Keep suggestions concise and focused on one feature at a time
- Provide clear step-by-step instructions for testing
- Ask specific questions about what worked/didn't work
- Update this document with findings after each testing session
- Suggest practical debugging steps for any issues encountered

The user prefers responses that are:
- Direct and to the point
- Focused on one testing area at a time
- Include specific criteria for success/failure
- Avoid unnecessary technical explanations unless requested

## Current Progress (March 7, 2024)

We have completed testing of the user registration functionality and found it to be working with minor issues (no confirmation email received). The next step is to test the login functionality, which has been prepared but not yet executed. Testing will continue from this point in the next session.

Next tests to run:
1. Login functionality (successful login, failed login, account lockout)
2. Password reset flow
3. Team management features

## How to Use This Document

- ‚úÖ = Feature tested and working correctly
- ‚ùå = Feature tested and not working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Feature partially working or has minor issues
- üîÑ = Testing in progress
- üìù = Notes or observations about testing attempts
- ‚¨ú = Not yet tested

After each test, update the status indicator and add detailed notes about what was tested, how it was tested, any issues encountered, and any fixes applied. This creates a valuable knowledge base for the entire team.
